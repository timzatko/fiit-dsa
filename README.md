# Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

School projects from Data Structures and Algorithms course written in _C_.

* [1st-project](./1st-project/Source.C) - implementation of the `malloc` function in C. A binary search tree ([treap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap)) is used for keeping track of free blocks.
* [2nd-project](./2nd-project/Source.C) - implementation of the binary search tree and the hash map.
* [3rd-project](./3rd-project/Source.C) - application of the [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for the shortest path search in the three-dimensional problem.
